Recurrence
The recurrence pattern is not valid.
The changes made to specific instances of this series will be cancelled and those events will match the series again.
The duration of the event must be shorter than how frequently it occurs. Shorten the duration, or change the recurrence pattern in the recurrence event editor.
Some months have fewer than the selected date. For these months, the occurrence will fall on the last date of the month.
Two occurrences of the same event cannot occur on the same day.
